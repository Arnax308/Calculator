A simple Calculator, that I made using tkinter and python. This was one of the first things I made while trying to learn tkinter. Recent changes have been made so that it could atleast compete with other calculators out there. 
I like using apps with sleek UIs so it is only fair that whatever I make has some good UI. While it may not have the best UI, but it is as good as I can make it!
